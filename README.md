Task 5: Threat Actor Profile Summary

In 2008 on August 7th Russian and Georgia were at war with each other.    But during this conflict Russia infiltrated into Georgia's cyberspace.   Which was the first large-scale Cyber attack on a country.    Russia blocked, rerouted traffic and seized sections of Georgian cyberspace.
This attack was too large and coordinated to be from an independent hacker.    Evidence had shown that the attack was led by the Russian business Network(RBN)  which was also suspected to be funded by the Kremlin.    A Cyber attack can potentially destabilize a country's economy and security infrastructure.    It was not just one Cyber attack however but multiple across the year targeting George's internet facilities.    
On July 20th the website of the president of Georgia was attacked by a DDOS attack  and was knocked offline for 24 hours,  the website also got infected by malware named name.avi.exe which when activated would flood the site with pictures of the current president of Georgia being compared to Hitler.   The virus acted like a propaganda weapon against Georgia.    On Thursday August 7th  a large number of George's internet servers were put under external control just before Russia's invasion of Georgia started.
In my diamond model the adversary the RBN would develop a technique which was a political defacement attack to try to damage the Georgian government reputation.   The infrastructure used was a malware payload called name.avi.exe  and would connect to the president of Georgia's website.
A couple of Georgia’s news agencies were also attacked, such as paralyzing the GHN news agency’s website for 2 weeks.   while another one would deal with constant cyber attacks.   Russia attacking news agencies allows them to control the flow of information which is a valuable resource in war.   
And finally there was an information site that provided information and tools for independent hackers to attack Georgian sites they would have a list of sites to attack,   The site was called  Stopgeorgia.ru.



Task 6: Reflection Questions 

How does the Diamond Model help in understanding threat actors?

The diamond model helps me understand the difference between a tool and a resource.   For example a program would be infrastructure and a strategy would be a capability.

What challenges did you face in identifying each vertex?

I was still making it the model I was thinking about if funding would count as an infrastructure or a capability.

How could this model support proactive defense strategies?

It helps you understand how an attack plays out in a technical and a strategical point of view at the same time.
